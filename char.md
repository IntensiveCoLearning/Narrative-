### 2024.09.13

Scope: Network States, Chapter 1 & Chapter 5 (First half of 5.3)

#### 1. Quickstart

##### What is Network States
> Short definition: A network state is a **highly aligned** **online** community with a capacity for collective action that **crowdfunds territory** around the world and eventually gains **diplomatic recognition** from pre-existing states.

> When we think of a nation state, we immediately think of the lands, but when we think of a network state, we should instantly think of the **minds**.

> Full definition: A network state is a **social network** with a moral innovation, a sense of **national consciousness**, a recognized **founder**, a capacity for **collective action**, an in-person level of **civility**, an integrated **cryptocurrency**, a **consensual government** limited by a **social smart contract**, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical **territories**, a virtual **capital**, and an on-chain **census** that proves a large enough **population**, **income,** and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of **diplomatic recognition**.

> Different states will focus on different metrics; imagine a network state premised on improving its citizens’ overall [life expectancy](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1287395551487524864), or one aimed at provably right-shifting the [income distribution](https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-mountains/) for all. You get what you measure.

##### What is a Country?
- Numerical definition
	- aggregates the cryptographically audited censuses of startup societies
	- population, land, income
- Societal definition
	- diplomatically recognized by other countries as a legitimate polity capable of self-determination
##### ✍️ Thoughts & Questions
###### Thoughts
- 与传统国家的区别：
	- 范围的划定不是依赖土地疆域的 physicality，而是具有相同 moral pursuit 的人口。是从观念 - 人 - 物理地点的过程。
	- 在使命愿景上更加 specific，可以是延长寿命或收入分配范式转换。 --似乎更强调个体而非所谓国家机器/国家形象？
- 与线上社区的区别：强调 minds，但依旧需要物理世界的领土（不需要确定物理首都，而是 virtual capital），以及外交认可。
###### Questions
- territory 具有二重性？如果既属于某个已有的国家，也属于某个 network states，那么“领土”的概念是否存在冲突？-- 可能与 territory 的目的有关
	- 在 5.3 中的回答：You can do many things online, but not everything. Without physical territory you can’t build FDA-free zones, or NRC-free areas, or the [Keto Kosher](https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states#keto-kosher-the-sugar-free-society) community, or many kinds of substantive [parallel societies](https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states#examples-of-parallel-societies-physical-network-archipelagos). You also can’t meet, mate, mingle, and do all the other things humans do in person. And most importantly you’re not going to be taken seriously as a successor to the nation state without a large physical footprint. The approach of knitting together crowdfunded physical territory into a network archipelago addresses these issues.
- diplomatic recognition 的必要性是什么？-- 看到 1.5 小节，这是 country 的社会定义的必要条件。 -- 那为什么要成为 country？
	- 在 5.3 中的回答：Basically, without diplomatic recognition, you aren’t considered real. - to write laws governing the territory, to defend the territory not being invaded, to issue passport & trade, etc.


#### 5. From National States to Network States

##### Nation State
> a nation state is a geographic region of the world ruled by a group of humans we call a government.

> [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nation-state) provides a more precise definition, namely that a nation state is a “territorially bounded sovereign polity” that is “ruled in the name of a community of citizens that identify themselves as a nation.” And that latter bit is key, because a nation state is not _just_ a government that controls a territory. It’s supposed to be a government that _represents_ a distinct people, a nation.

- nation 强调 ruled in the name of a community of citizens，区别于 governenment as to country

> six essential parts of the **state**: borders, population, central government, international sovereignty, diplomatic recognition, and the domestic monopoly on violence.

- nation: a group of people with common descent, history, culture, or language
- state: their government
- Nation State: starts from people and culture, then to territory (认为 sealand 不成立的原因是它们从 territory & government 开始，而不是从 people & culture 开始)

- Nation vs State
	- The state is a political and legal entity, while a nation is a cultural, ethnic, and psychological identity.
	- The state is bound by laws and threat of force, while a nation is bound by sentiments and linguistic/genetic/cultural alignment.
	- The state is top-down and hierarchical, while the nation is bottom-up and peer-to-peer.
	- And, as above, the state has a fixed territory, a government and sovereignty over a territory, while a nation typically has shared language, culture, and/or ancestry.

- Nation comes first, then create states, then states influence the nations (enhance national culture, popularize language speaking - political border & national culture feedback loop)

##### Nation
> A large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory.

- Examples
	- nations _with_ states (Japanese, Spanish)
	- nations _without_ states (Kurds, Catalonians)
	- nations with _partially sovereign_ states (Taiwan)
	- multiethnic states that are trying to create _proposition nations_ (America, Singapore, France)
	- imposed multiethnic states that don’t even have a proposition to bind them (many “states” formed as shotgun marriages in the aftermath of European colonialism)
	- civilization states that are multiethnic, but have _long-standing cultural ties_ that unify their constituent nations (China, India)
- Nations may not always have a single state. The Kurds lack a state, while the Koreans are split into two states. 

##### Why were Nation States Founded?
- Origin of the European nation state: Peace of Westphalia （威斯特伐利亚和约） 1648
	- divided territory by lines on a map. Over each territory thus delineated, there was a government that represented the people in that territory, with the right to exercise force on their behalf.
- Innovated for **violence reduction** (in theory)

##### Network States
###### Definition
- A social network - selective admission
- A moral innovation - shared beliefs / collective purpose
- A sense of national consciousness
- A recognized founder - make early decisions before smart contract runs, allow peaceful exit
- A capacity for collective action - ability to achieve the collective purpose
- An in-person level of civility
- An integrated cryptocurrency - digital backbone
- An archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories - physical footprint
- A consensual government limited by a social smart contract
	- In practice, we say that a user has consented to be governed by a startup society if he has signed a _social smart contract_ that gives a system administrator _limited_ privileges over that user’s digital life in return for admission to the startup society.
- A virtual capital
- An on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate footprint - as a proof for clout for diplomatic recognition
- Attain a measure of diplomatic recognition

##### ✍️ Thoughts & Questions
###### Thoughts
- States 定义中有而 Network States 中没有的：central government，international sovereignty, the domestic monopoly on violence
- 对于 sealand 不是 nation state 的讨论：所以现有 nation state 与领土的紧密联系，只是因为前网络时代人们只能在线下聚集，因此使领土看上去成为了前置条件。但实际上应该是先有人与文化，再去 claim territory
- It's important for Nations to have **a distinct culture** to defend
	- 如果境内有多种 nationality，则称作 multiethnic empires（如苏联，而非 nation states）
###### Questions
- 如果 nation 更强调 shared values，为什么不叫 network nations？通过强调 states，希望获得的是什么呢？政治主权？  --_Stateless nations_ like the Kurds are not nation states because they lack a formally recognized territory and government.
